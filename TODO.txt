BEFORE REAGONALS
Add slides (into, into cave, and out of cave).
Add enemie ai (basic).
Improve textures (if there is time).


BEFORE NATIONALS (if we get there)
Make permanate textures.
Add in cleric, jail, and elder level.
Add in some easter eggs (optional).


WHEN SUDMITTING
Export all .tmx files into .json format. Should improve proformance. MOVE ORIGINAL .TMX FILES AFTERWARD. KEEPING THEM IN THE SAME DIRECTORY CAUSES PROBLEMS, AND DELETING THEM WILL BE PROBLEMATIC.
